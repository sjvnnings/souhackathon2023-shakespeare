# Southern Oregon University Hackathon 2023 Submission

Authors: Samuel Jennings (sjvnnings) & Brayden Edwards (BraydenJamesE)


### Information
* This submission is a group project
* Language: C++
* Theme: Shakespeare

### Design
Our program is a console-based game where the user plays as Julius Caesar fighting to escape his enemies. We designed this game with scalability in mind. While our time constraints didn't allow for total architecture usage, we are confident in the code's capacity to scale to deeper simulation mechanics. Additionally, our text output is written in iambic pentameter, just as Shakespeare wrote Julius Caesar. 

### How to Play
The program was written in CLion. You can compile and run the code by simply opening it in CLion and hitting run in the top right corner. A Windows executable is also available in the "Releases" section on GitHub.

Type "Help" for a list of commands. "J" represents your character, Julius Caesar. "C" represents an enemy. "]" Indicates the exit. You must move to this point to win.
