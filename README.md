# Southern Oregon University Hackathon 2023 Submission

Authors: Samuel Jennings & Brayden Edwards


### Information
* This submission is a group project
* Language: C++
* Theme: Shakespeare

### Design
Our program is a console-based game where the user plays as Julius Caesar fighting to escape his enemies. We designed this game with scalability in mind. While our time constraints didn't allow for total architecture usage, we are confident in the code's capacity to scale to deeper simulation mechanics. Additionally, our text output is written in iambic pentameter, just as Shakespeare wrote Julius Caesar. 

### How to Play
The program was written in CLion. You can run the code by simply opening it in CLion and hitting run. We have also included an executable that can be run on all operating systems.
